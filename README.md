# Image Classification On CIFAR-10 Dataset Using CNN
INSTALLATION
------------
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

* NumPy
* Keras
* matplotlib
* tensorflow
* seaborn
 
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

EXECUTION
---------
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Image_Classification_CIFAR_Dataset/ (that contains this README) and run the following command:

jupyter notebook CNN_CIFAR.ipynb

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser. You can also use Google Colab for easy access as it already has all the packages installed.

ABOUT THE DATASET
-----------------
• It is an inbuilt dataset from keras.

• The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class.

• The training part of the datas contains 50000 datas with 32 * 32 each.

• The testing part of the datas contains 10000 datas with 32 * 32 each.

• The 32 * 32 matrix of each data represents the pixel's color values of each data.

FLOW OF THE PROJECT
-------------------
Program has been separated into two divisions:

i) Classifying the CIFAR-10 dataset.

ii) Recognising the objects in the images.
